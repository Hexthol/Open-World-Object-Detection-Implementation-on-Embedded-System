# Open-World-Object-Section-Implementation-on-Embedded-System

This is the implmentation of WUSTL CSE521 final project. We deplyed three models, YOLOv8, PROB, and UnSniffer on differrent embedded systems for open world object detection. For YOLOv8, we ran it on both RaspberryPi 4B and Jetson Nano Xavier. For PROB and UnSniffer, we deployed them on the Jetson Nano Xavier because of the requirement of GPU resources.
