# Open-World-Object-Section-Implementation-on-Embedded-System


## Overview
This is the implmentation of WUSTL CSE521 final project. We deplyed three models, YOLOv8, PROB, and UnSniffer on differrent embedded systems for open world object detection. For YOLOv8, we ran it on both Raspberry Pi 4B and Jetson Nano Xavier. For PROB and UnSniffer, we deployed them on the Jetson Nano Xavier because of the requirement of GPU resources.

## Preparation
Hardwares: Raspberry Pi 4B (Raspberry Pi OS 64bit) and Jetson Nano Xavier (Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS && JetPack 5.1.2)
Accessories: USB webcam and USB speaker

## Environemt on Raspberry Pi 4B

```shell
python main.py
```
